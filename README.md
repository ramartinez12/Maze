# Maze
Developed a self generating maze using the disjoint set forest data structure which would accept any size preferred by the user and will always have a path from the start to finish.

To run the program, you need to download both files from this repository, you will need to run the Maze file which will use the StdDraw to generate the GUI for the Maze.
